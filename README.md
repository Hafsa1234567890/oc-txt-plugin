Txt Generator for OctoberCMS

# What is it #
As the title says, it allows you to generate [humans.txt](http://humanstxt.org/Standard.html) and [robots.txt](http://www.robotstxt.org/orig.html) for your web app.

## Installation ##
Until this plugin is added to the market place, you will have to use the following method to install it:
```
cd /your/october/project/plugins/folder
mkdir -p mohsin
cd $_
wget https://github.com/SaifurRahmanMohsin/Txt/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
rm $_
mv Txt-master txt
```
Logout from your backend and login again. This will create the necessary tables for the plugin to work. You have now installed Txt!
